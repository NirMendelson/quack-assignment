          "actualAnswer": "Customers should handle copyright claims on projects by disputing the claim using the license certificate they can generate from their account dashboard under downloads, selecting the track they used. It's important to remind them that it can take up to 30 days for the claim to clear . If they encounter any issues or have further questions, they should contact support via email or chat, as phone support is not available .",
