          "actualAnswer": "Based on the policy excerpts, besides being within the 14-day window, refunds are possible under these additional conditions: 1. No activity requirement: The account must have absolutely no boards created - meaning zero activity on the account [c:chunk_1 -> Refunds and Billing]. 2. Proof of payment: Customers must provide documentation showing proof of payment, such as a receipt [c:chunk_1 -> Refunds and Billing]. 3. No account renewal: The account must not have already renewed, as no refunds are available once renewal has occurred [c:chunk_2 -> Refunds and Billing]. There is also a special case mentioned where refunds for team plans or bulk license purchases might be handled individually on a case by case basis, and customers should contact finance@monday.fake for these situations [c:chunk_2 -> Refunds and Billing]. All of these conditions must be met in addition to the 14-day time requirement for a refund to be possible.",

          "actualAnswer": "No, refunds are not offered if the account has already renewed [c:chunk_1 -> Refunds and Billing]. This policy applies consistently across different account types, with one exception: team plans or bulk license purchases may be handled on a case by case basis [c:chunk_3 -> Refunds and Billing].

          "actualAnswer": "Based on the policy document, refunds for team plans (also referred to as bulk license purchases) are handled on a case by case basis [c:chunk_1 -> Refunds]. This means each request is evaluated individually rather than following standard refund criteria. For team plan refund requests, customers should contact finance@monday.fake [c:chunk_3 -> Refunds].

          "expectedAnswer": "Billing continues until the renewal date, and then stops. No refund is issued for unused time.",
          "actualAnswer": "When a customer cancels their subscription mid-cycle, several things happen: The cancellation does not take effect immediately. Instead, billing continues for the remainder of the current cycle until the next renewal date, at which point the billing stops [c:chunk_6 -> Subscriptions and Cancellations]. Customers will not receive any money back for the current billing period they're in when they cancel [c:chunk_2 -> Subscriptions and Cancellations]. The policy specifically states that no refunds are provided for any unused portion of time remaining in the current cycle [c:chunk_9 -> Subscriptions and Cancellations]. The cancellation only prevents future billing by stopping the automatic renewal at the next scheduled renewal date [c:chunk_3 -> Subscriptions and Cancellations].",
