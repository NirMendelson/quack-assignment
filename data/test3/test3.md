So Canva is free but also not free because there’s Canva Free which everyone can use forever and then there’s Canva Pro which is like around $12.99 a month if you pay monthly or cheaper if you do the yearly subscription (I think about $119.99 a year but don’t quote me unless a customer asks and then yes, it’s that), but sometimes people get confused because Canva for Teams is also like Pro but different because it’s meant for businesses and has a different pricing structure depending on how many people are in the team and the first five seats cost the same and then after that it’s per person extra, but education accounts are actually free (teachers and students get Pro features but they need to apply) and nonprofits can also get Canva Pro free forever if they qualify, though they have to fill out the special nonprofit form and sometimes they get denied if they don’t meet the eligibility so that becomes a ticket issue, and billing is always in USD except when it’s not because in some countries like Australia or the EU it shows in local currency but the backend still tracks it in USD so receipts can look confusing, speaking of receipts they always go to the email address of the billing owner and people often lose them but you can tell them to check their “Billing & Plans” tab inside account settings because all invoices are downloadable there, but they complain anyway because the button is sometimes hidden under the plan details so you need to explain where it is and maybe send screenshots, refunds are only possible if they request within 14 days after the charge and only if they didn’t keep using the product (so if they downloaded a bunch of stuff already it gets tricky but technically Canva policy says yes refund but not after annual renewals once the 14 days pass, so it’s a strict window), renewals are automatic by default so if they don’t want to be charged again they need to cancel before the renewal date, which always sneaks up on them because they forget and then they want a refund but that’s the same 14-day rule, another thing is people often subscribe through Apple or Google Play which is a whole different mess because Canva support cannot cancel those directly, customers must cancel through Apple ID or Google Play account, and refunds also need to go through Apple/Google which always frustrates customers because they think we can just press a button but we can’t, oh and family plans don’t exist but sometimes people ask so the answer is no only Teams and Pro, there’s also Enterprise which is custom pricing (they need to talk to sales, don’t give a number because it depends on seats and contract size), students in universities who don’t have education verification can still get Canva Pro if they just buy it like normal, payment methods accepted are credit card, PayPal, and sometimes local methods like iDEAL or Sofort but it depends on region, there’s no crypto payments even though customers ask sometimes, people also ask about gift cards but Canva doesn’t really sell gift cards, there are some resellers that provide vouchers but that’s not an official product so best to redirect them, storage limits depend on plan too but that’s usually a features issue not billing but sometimes it comes up because Pro gets 1TB of storage and Free gets only 5GB so people upgrade just for that, invoices list VAT if applicable (especially in EU) but in other regions tax is included in the price already, people often get confused why they were billed twice but usually it’s because they accidentally created two accounts with different emails and both have Pro subscriptions so you need to walk them through account recovery and checking which account has the plan, sometimes people also forget they signed up for the free trial that auto-converts to paid after 30 days, so complaints about “I didn’t authorize this” are actually the trial ending, support is supposed to explain that clearly and check the trial date, Pro trials only work once per account (but people try with multiple emails), and Canva Pro is cheaper with yearly billing but you can switch between yearly and monthly in settings but you can’t switch mid-cycle without canceling, so if they want to downgrade they have to wait for the plan to end, downgrading from Teams to Free works but any extra seats will be removed, and yes customers lose Pro features immediately after cancellation unless they still have time left in the billing cycle then it runs until the date ends, another important note is if the customer asks whether prices are negotiable the answer is no except for Enterprise, and nonprofit plans can’t be combined with Teams or Enterprise, also no refunds if the subscription was purchased through a third-party reseller or bundled with another service, and the billing cycle always matches the start date of the plan, so if they buy on the 12th of the month it renews on the 12th not the 1st, unless the store (Apple/Google) has a different cycle but that’s rare, in summary the billing part of Canva is very structured but customers find it chaotic so support staff need to memorize these little quirks otherwise the tickets bounce back, and finally: always check if they’re on Free, Pro, Teams, Enterprise, Education, or Nonprofit because pricing/billing questions always depend on which of those buckets they belong to.

So Canva has a lot of tools like literally too many to count sometimes people think it’s just a drag-and-drop graphic thing but actually it does presentations, videos, whiteboards, websites (sort of, not real websites but one-page sites with links, still counts), documents like Word but prettier, and even resumes, menus, social media posts (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube thumbnails, LinkedIn banners, Pinterest pins, business cards, flyers, posters, invitations, logos, pretty much anything you can think of), and the features keep changing because they release updates constantly so what’s true today may shift tomorrow, anyway the main thing people use is templates — there are like hundreds of thousands of them maybe millions, and templates are free or Pro-only depending on the crown icon, so if someone says “why can’t I use this?” it’s because it’s Pro-only, tell them they can still customize free ones, Canva also has stock photos, videos, and audio tracks, again Pro gets millions more while Free gets a smaller library, background remover is one of the most asked about features but it’s Pro-only so Free users can’t use it, Magic Resize is another big one (lets you take a design and instantly resize it to Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, whatever) and again Pro-only, Magic Write is Canva’s AI writing assistant that can help draft text (kind of like ChatGPT but inside Canva), and there’s also Magic Edit and Magic Eraser for AI image editing (remove objects or change parts of a photo), also text-to-image (AI art generator) which is in beta but widely available, Brand Kit is super important for teams because it lets you upload logos, colors, fonts and apply them easily, Free plan only gets one color palette but Pro/Teams get full brand kit with fonts and logos, people often ask why they can’t upload fonts — answer: that’s Pro/Teams only, collaboration tools exist in all plans but Pro/Teams get better control like brand templates and approval workflows, you can invite others to edit designs in real-time (like Google Docs), whiteboards allow sticky notes, diagrams, brainstorming, and even a timer, some customers don’t know Canva has a video editor but it does and it’s surprisingly full-featured: you can cut, trim, add transitions, text overlays, stock footage, background music, and export in MP4, you can even record yourself on camera or screen record within Canva, presentations are another area, there’s a “present” button to do slideshows, also presenter view, and a “record yourself presenting” feature where it saves a video with your face in a bubble, websites are limited but allow custom domain publishing if you connect your own domain (Pro feature), otherwise it’s a Canva link, file export is a huge area of confusion because you can download PNG, JPG, PDF (standard and print), SVG (Pro-only), MP4, GIF, etc, Free plan doesn’t get transparent background (Pro-only) so people complain, animations exist too: you can animate text, elements, or whole pages, again Free has some basics but Pro has more options, printing service is available (like business cards, posters, t-shirts) but only in some regions, customers ask about bleed and crop marks for printing — yes Canva provides them if you select PDF Print, storage: Free users get 5GB, Pro users get 1TB, Teams also 1TB per member, file upload size limit is 500MB for videos and 100MB for images (subject to change), mobile app has almost all features but not as smooth as desktop, sometimes Magic Resize doesn’t appear in mobile so that’s normal, desktop app exists too (Windows and Mac), but it’s just a wrapper around the website, offline mode doesn’t really exist because Canva needs internet but some drafts get cached temporarily, language support is wide but not every language is perfect, customers ask about right-to-left text (Hebrew, Arabic) — it works but sometimes alignment bugs happen, fonts are hundreds but if you want custom ones upload in Brand Kit (again Pro), folders are a feature to organize designs (Free gets limited, Pro unlimited), scheduler exists for social media: you can post directly to Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Twitter, TikTok, Slack — not all platforms but many, free plan doesn’t have advanced scheduling (Pro does), charts and graphs exist (editable with data tables), you can even import CSVs, diagrams with Smartmockups exist too (mock your designs on phones, mugs, etc.), Pro unlocks more mockups, one weird thing is that Teams users can assign template permissions (who can edit vs who can only use), integration: Canva connects with Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, Box, HubSpot, Slack, Mailchimp, etc. but some integrations require Pro, apps inside Canva exist (like QR code generator, Giphy, Bitmoji, Google Maps), customers often don’t realize Canva has these, audio features include trimming, adjusting volume, fade in/out, text-to-speech doesn’t exist yet but people ask, brand controls let admins lock colors/fonts so teammates can’t change them, Free users don’t get this, Pro users can also set up template locking, videos can export up to 4K now (new update), but file size limits may block it, Canva Docs is like Google Docs but prettier, with embedded designs, charts, and AI writing (Magic Write), but it doesn’t have version history like Google Docs so warn customers, you can embed Canva designs in websites (via embed code), live collaboration has comments, mentions, and notifications, some users ask about keyboard shortcuts — yes, lots of them (press “/” for quick search), Canva also has “Magic Grab” (new AI tool that moves objects in photos), again Pro, basically most AI stuff is Pro, Free gets just basic design tools, another hidden feature is presentation “Canva Live” which lets audience join with a code and react with emojis/questions in real-time, works in education a lot, and lastly: features depend on browser too — Chrome/Edge work best, Safari sometimes has issues with animations or AI, always ask them to try another browser.

To use Canva you first sign up which is free and can be with Google, Facebook, email, Apple ID or even a Microsoft account but some users forget which one they used so they can’t log in later and think their designs disappeared but usually they just made two accounts so always ask them to check all emails, anyway once logged in the home page has “What will you design?” boxes like Presentation, Instagram Post, Logo, etc but some people get confused because they want custom size so you tell them click “Custom Size” in the top right where they can type pixels or inches or mm and sometimes it’s hidden behind a button depending on screen width, designs are autosaved in real-time so no save button exists which confuses people who come from Word or Photoshop, if they lose work it’s usually because they logged into a different account or cleared cache while offline, to start editing you drag templates, photos, shapes, text, elements, etc. onto the canvas, double click to edit text, click elements to move or resize with handles, hold shift to resize proportionally, Free users don’t get fancy fonts with crowns, Pro users can upload their own fonts in Brand Kit, uploading images is via the “Uploads” tab, max size is 100MB per file (videos 500MB), dragging from desktop works too, background remover button only appears for Pro when selecting an image, Magic Resize button appears after you click “Resize” at top, for downloads you click “Share” → “Download” but people always miss it because “Share” sounds like posting on social, formats available depend on plan: PNG, JPG, PDF Standard/Print, GIF, MP4, SVG (Pro only), Transparent background (Pro only), compress file size (Pro only), printing (physical) is also inside “Share” menu which makes no sense but that’s where it is, you can invite people to edit by typing their email in the “Share” box, if they don’t get the invite check spam, editing together in real-time is possible and you see their cursor, commenting works with right click → “Comment,” deleting designs is in the “Projects” section (formerly “All your designs”), people often can’t find trash but it’s under “Projects” → “Trash,” items stay 30 days then permanently deleted, to restore click “Restore,” mobile app is almost identical but smaller buttons, some features like Magic Resize may not show, but you can still download and share from phone, uploading video is possible on mobile too, some people ask if you can use Canva offline — not really, only cached drafts open offline, publishing directly to social media: click “Share” → “More” → pick Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn etc, note that Instagram personal accounts don’t work, only business accounts via Facebook integration, scheduling posts is Pro-only, keyboard shortcuts: T = text box, R = rectangle, L = line, C = circle, Cmd/Ctrl+D duplicates, Cmd/Ctrl+K links, lots of these but customers rarely know, “Folders” organize designs, Pro gets unlimited, Free limited, searching inside Canva: use search bar at top for templates, elements, audio, video, but customers often type random words like “marketing vibes cool” and get nothing, tell them to try simpler terms, creating a team: go to “Settings” → “People,” add emails, Free allows teams but features limited, Pro Teams get brand kit controls, if a customer can’t find their Brand Kit it’s probably because they are on Free, presentations: create presentation template → “Present” at top → choose “Standard,” “Autoplay,” or “Presenter view,” Canva Live is under “Present,” it generates a code audience enters at canva.live, customers don’t know about this but it’s fun for classes, printing designs: select “Print Products” in home page (business cards, flyers, t-shirts), shipping cost depends on location, cannot edit order after payment, designing websites: choose “Website” template, then publish → “Free Canva Domain” or “Connect a Domain” (Pro only), website is one-page scroller, not a real multi-page website, but works fine for portfolios, resumes, events, some users ask about SEO — very basic, title and description only, exporting presentations as PPTX works but complex animations may not transfer, exporting as PDF Print for high quality is recommended, for video editing: upload clips → drag timeline → trim → add transitions, export MP4, you can also record yourself via “Record” option, screen record is Chrome-only, Canva Docs: open “Docs” → type text → use “/” to insert elements, charts, AI writing, but no footnotes or advanced formatting, so academics often complain, adding charts: go to “Elements” → “Charts,” can input data manually or paste CSV, Smartmockups: select a design → “Apps” → “Smartmockups,” put design on mugs, shirts, devices, free gets a few, Pro gets lots, right-to-left text support is okay but kerning issues sometimes, advise users to switch to supported fonts, if they complain about missing fonts explain licensing issues, uploading fonts must be OTF, TTF, or WOFF, cannot upload protected fonts, if users can’t find their designs tell them to check “Shared with you” or “Recent,” sometimes designs disappear due to cache so ask them to log out/in, and remind them Canva autosaves so if it’s gone it’s account confusion not lost work, also mobile push notifications sometimes fail but emails always send, profile settings under top-right icon allow name, email, password changes, customers often can’t change email if they used Google sign-in, they need to unlink Google first, two-factor authentication isn’t mandatory but available, people sometimes ask about watermarks — watermarks appear if they use Pro assets without Pro, solution is buy Pro or pay for that element individually ($1 or so), that’s allowed, once paid the watermark goes away, video exports with Pro music add watermark if not paid, always tell customers to preview before paying.

If Canva isn’t loading the first thing is always clear cache or try a different browser because Chrome works best, Safari sometimes bugs, Firefox is okay but not always, Edge surprisingly works fine, and if the user says “nothing loads” it’s usually either their internet or Canva’s status page (status.canva.com) shows downtime, which happens occasionally but not often, designs disappearing is 99% logging into the wrong account (Google vs email vs Apple), so make them check all possible emails, if fonts don’t work they might be trying to upload unsupported formats or they’re on Free so they can’t upload fonts, if video export fails it’s usually because the file is too big (limit 500MB upload, export fails if too many elements), tell them to try shorter clips or export in lower resolution, transparent background button missing = they’re on Free plan, background remover not showing = Free plan, Magic Resize missing = Free plan, watermarks all over design = they used Pro elements without paying, solution: upgrade to Pro or pay $1 per element, if a customer says “my payment was declined” it could be expired card, insufficient funds, PayPal issues, or local method not supported, tell them to try another payment method, if they can’t cancel subscription remind them that App Store/Google Play purchases must be canceled there, not inside Canva, refunds only within 14 days (see Part 1), so don’t promise refunds outside that, printing issues: if the colors don’t match what they see on screen it’s because of RGB vs CMYK, Canva doesn’t do full professional color proofing, so slight differences are normal, shipping delays are handled by the print partner, not Canva directly, if the download button is greyed out check if they’re on a browser that blocks popups or ad blockers, sometimes incognito mode fixes it, mobile crashes = update the app, reinstall if needed, Android has more crashes than iOS, performance issues often solved by clearing design of too many elements (huge designs can lag), max pages per design is technically 100 but above 50 it starts lagging, Canva doesn’t support offline editing properly so if they try to use it without internet things break, if they can’t schedule posts to Instagram it’s because they don’t have a business account connected to Facebook, TikTok integration works but only for business accounts too, if notifications don’t arrive check email spam or mobile settings, customers ask if Canva supports Hebrew or Arabic right-to-left properly, answer: mostly yes but sometimes alignment bugs, if a Pro feature isn’t working even though they paid, ask them to log out and back in or check if they have multiple Canva accounts, sometimes people accidentally pay for Pro on one account and log in with another, file corruption is rare but if download fails repeatedly they can try exporting as PDF then converting externally, Canva doesn’t support importing PSD/AI files fully, only PDFs or SVGs (Pro only), sometimes images look blurry after download, solution: export as PDF Print or PNG not JPG, charts not updating usually because they didn’t click “Update,” if Smartmockups doesn’t load it’s usually browser cache, Canva Docs not saving = they lost connection, autosave only works online, designs not found = check trash, they stay 30 days, teams not showing up = they’re logged in with the wrong account or team invitation expired, resend invite, if customer can’t see “Brand Kit” they’re on Free, if social media scheduler posts fail it’s usually because the social platform disconnected permissions, they need to reconnect, also Canva doesn’t let you schedule Instagram personal accounts at all, only business, if AI features (Magic Write, Magic Edit, etc.) don’t appear it’s because of region restrictions or browser issues, sometimes AI gets throttled if too many requests, advise waiting, Pro trials end after 30 days and auto-charge so “unauthorized charge” is usually that, no family plan exists so if they ask, answer is no, customers often think Canva deleted their designs after canceling Pro but designs remain, only Pro features disappear, slow performance = check design size, remove videos/images, or split into multiple designs, Canva doesn’t support version history like Google Docs so if they overwrite something it’s gone unless they duplicate designs first, support tickets for lost work almost always end in “wrong account,” printing bleed/crop marks are in PDF Print options, if they don’t see it they chose wrong download type, animations not exporting = probably GIF size too big, export as MP4 instead, Canva doesn’t integrate with every social media (no direct YouTube posting, no Twitch), so if they ask, answer is no, some customers ask if Canva accepts crypto payments = no, Canva isn’t Photoshop = don’t argue, Canva can’t do 3D modeling = no, Canva doesn’t have layer masks like Photoshop = no, Canva can’t open InDesign files = no, Canva watermarks free music tracks until paid = yes, Canva exports are capped at 30 minutes for videos (above that it errors), if user’s domain won’t connect to Canva site publishing = check CNAME settings, Canva only supports domains with providers that allow custom DNS, FAQs like “can I sell my Canva designs?” → yes if you use free assets or Pro assets under license, but you can’t resell unmodified templates, “can I trademark a Canva logo?” → no because elements aren’t exclusive, customers ask if Canva owns their designs, answer: no, they own their designs but Canva owns the platform and assets licensing, if a design is “stuck on loading” tell them to try duplicating it, works 90% of time, sometimes Canva servers just lag, status page shows updates, users asking for desktop offline mode: doesn’t exist, only web wrapper app, final random: Canva has dark mode but only on mobile app, not on desktop web, people complain but it’s true.
