          "content": "So Canva is free but also not free because there’s Canva Free which everyone can use forever and then there’s Canva Pro which is like around $12.99 a month if you pay monthly or cheaper if you do the yearly subscription (I think about $119.99 a year but don’t quote me unless a customer asks and then yes, it’s that), but sometimes people get confused because Canva for Teams is also like Pro but different because it’s meant for businesses and has a different pricing structure depending on how many people are in the team and the first five seats cost the same and then after that it’s per person extra, but education accounts are actually free (teachers and students get Pro features but they need to apply) and nonprofits can also get Canva Pro free forever if they qualify, though they have to fill out the special nonprofit form and sometimes they get denied if they don’t meet the eligibility so that becomes a ticket issue, and billing is always in USD except when it’s not because in some countries like Australia or the EU it shows in local currency but the backend still tracks it in USD so receipts can look confusing, speaking of receipts they always go to the email address of the billing owner and people often lose them but you can tell them to check their “Billing & Plans” tab inside account settings because all invoices are downloadable there, but they complain anyway because the button is sometimes hidden under the plan details so you need to explain where it is and maybe send screenshots, refunds are only possible if they request within 14 days",

So Canva has a lot of tools like literally too many to count sometimes people think it’s just a drag-and-drop graphic thing but actually it does presentations, videos, whiteboards, websites (sort of, not real websites but one-page sites with links, still counts), documents like Word but prettier, and even resumes, menus, social media posts (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube thumbnails, LinkedIn banners, Pinterest pins, business cards, flyers, posters, invitations, logos, pretty much anything you can think of),",
