monday.com Policy Document (draft v0.7?)

This document is not final. It is messy, contains repeated information, and mixes formats. Someone should clean it up, but here is what we have so far.

Refunds and billing: Refunds are available only within 14 days of the original purchase. Refunds are only possible if no boards were created at all, meaning literally zero activity in the account. Customers must also provide proof of payment, like a receipt, for the refund to be processed. If the account has already renewed, then there are no refunds available at all. Refunds for team plans, which are bulk license purchases, might be handled on a case by case basis, and the customer is asked to contact finance@monday.fake
 for those requests. There are no exceptions beyond this, and the policy is strict about the 14 day window. To summarize in JSON format: refundPolicy: window_days = 14, conditions = no boards created, proof of payment, exceptions = none.

Subscriptions and cancellations: Customers can cancel their subscription at any time in their account settings. However, cancelling does not mean they will receive money back for the current billing cycle. The cancellation only stops billing at the next renewal date. If you cancel in the middle of the cycle, billing continues until the renewal, and then it stops automatically. No refunds are issued for unused time in the current cycle.

Passwords and security: IT guidelines require that passwords must be changed every 90 days. Passwords should not be shared with coworkers under any circumstances. If a user forgets their password, the reset process is done through an email link. Two-factor authentication is recommended for additional security, although it is not enforced at this time.

Support information: The official support contact email is support@monday.fake
. Standard SLA is a response time of 24 to 48 hours. If no answer is received within 48 hours, the request escalates automatically to a higher priority queue. Customer service hours are from 09:00 to 18:00 UTC. Old documents sometimes state hours as 08:00 to 17:00, but those are outdated and should be ignored. To summarize the support section in JSON style: support: contact = support@monday.fake
, hours = 09:00–18:00 UTC, SLA = 24h–48h response, escalation = automatic after 48 hours with no reply.

Special notes: If a customer issues a chargeback with their bank or credit card provider, their account is banned immediately and permanently. There is no appeal process for this. Shipping is not offered at all, because monday.com is a digital product only. There are no boxes or hardware provided, and no physical shipping is involved. Refunds for team plans, as noted before, are handled case by case and require contacting finance@monday.fake
.

Features mentioned in this document include Boards, which are the main workspace for tasks and projects, and the Team plan, which is for bulk license or multi-user management. No other features are explicitly described in this particular policy draft.

To make things even more confusing, here is the same information in table form: Refund = 14 days, no boards created. Cancel = Anytime, but no refund for current cycle. Passwords = Must change every 90 days. Support = support@monday.fake
, 24–48h response time. Chargebacks = account banned. Customer hours = 09:00–18:00 UTC.
